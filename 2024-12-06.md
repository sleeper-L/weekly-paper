# Summary
1. learned the third chapter of the book *State Estimation for Robotics* and watched the lectures about the book given by Gao Xiang.

â€‹	I found that this part of the book is hard to understand and there are too many formulas to deduce, so I decided to turn this to side mission and continue learning when the time is ample. Now I have learned the relationship between batch processing and recursion and built the framework of the generalized gaussian filtering, 

2. listed several papers about IMU feature matching and took some notes about these paper.

   In my perspective, two of them are well written and worth a read. On the front end, the effect of IMU is to help find the location of point features or line features to accelerate feature matching.

3. ran the VINS-Mono and VINS-Fusion arithmetic.

   It needs to remember to use the 2.1 version of cere. However, the root directory of my computer is full when I tried to run LIVW and RINO and installed the pcl.

4. drew the flow chart of MSCKF with my understanding

# Plan 
1.  keep learning the third and the fourth chapter of the book State Estimation for Robotics and take notes.
2.  consolidate and organize previous knowledge points
3.  review the code of MSCKF and learn how to realize the function of every part when I try to write the code myself.
# Problem
1. Maybe I need to reinstall the system as the memory I allocated to the root directory is not enough.
