# Summary
1. prepared for the final exams especially for numerical analysis.

​	the first chapter to the third chapter are relatively straightforward; the fourth chapter is about interpolation and approximation; the fifth chapter is about numerical integration on an interpolated basis; the sixth chapter is about ordinary differential equations including RK4; the last chapter is not easy to understand.

2. read some parts of the paper and code about SchurVINS.

3. watched videos about machine learning given by Dr.Wu and compiled some notes for review.




# Plan 
1. relearn the code of SchurVINS and compare with MSCKF to understand better.

​	I hope I can patiently understand the meaning of each part of the code and be able to get to the point where I have a general idea of how to implement that part of the function.

2. review the paper  *SchurVINS: Schur Complement-Based Lightweight Visual Inertial Navigation System* and organize the frame.

​	I wish I can have a better understanding of how to build a complete residual model and how to decompose it with Schur compensation.

# Problem
1. From now on, I intend to write down all the problems I encounter in a notepad and solve the points as soon as possible since the problems encountered before were not dealt with in time, they were forgotten. No delays.
1. I need to get my workaround in order.
