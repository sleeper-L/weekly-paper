# Summary
1. reviewed the first two chapters of the book *State Estimation for Robotics* and watched the lectures about the book given by Gao Xiang.

​	I sorted out the contents I have learned in order to review the knowledge quickly later.

2. learned the OC-EKF partly and derived the formula with the help of blogs, but haven't understood the Lagrangian multiplier method and KKT deeply.

​       OC-EKF will design the appropriate Φ and H to make sure the zero dimension of the observation matrix is equal to the unobservable dimension of the system.



# Plan 
1.  keep learning the third chapter of the book State Estimation for Robotics and take notes.
2.  consolidate and organize previous knowledge points
# Problem
1. Although I have spent much time learning MSCKF and read the paper about MSCKF many times, I still feel that the algorithm is fuzzy to me.
