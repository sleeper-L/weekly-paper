# Summary
1. learned [_Visual-Inertial Navigation: A Concise Review_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8793604) and had a better undertanding of VIO.
   It is a comprehensive review of visual inertial navigation which can help beginners a lot. However there are also many complex concepts that are expected to be learned
2. tried to understand  _[MSCEqF: A Multi State Constraint Equivariant Filter for Vision-Aided Inertial Navigation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10325586)_ and failed.
3. kept learning [_InGVIO: A Consistent Invariant Filter for Fast and High-Accuracy GNSS-Visual-Inertial Odometry_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10040716) and tried to solve some experimental problems.
    If have the algorithm framework the code will be much easier to understand.
4. watched the first four of _the fourteen lectures on visual SLAM_.
   It helped to understand some concepts.
# Plan 
1. prepare a presentation about InGVIO.
2. try to figure out InGVIO's framework.
3. listen to the courses about SLAM-14 if have time.
# Problem
1. What is InGVIO's framework?
2. How to integrate GNSS into VIO?
