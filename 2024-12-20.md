# Summary
1. reviewed the first chapter to the fourth chapter of the book *State Estimation for Robotics* and rewatched the lectures about the book given by Gao Xiang in order to prepare the PPT.

â€‹	I decided to put the book aside for the time being as I thought this is the end of this stage of learning. For the first to fourth chapter, I decided to study in small chunks after I had gone through it and had a general outline. For the sixth and seventh chapter, I decided to learn the knowledge from other books. For the left chapter, I decided to learn when I have enough time such as winter vacation.

2. collated some of the Linux and ROS instructions previously used.

   I thought that having a tutorial book about those problems I met may be better and will help a lot when I face the problems again or I reinstall something in the computer.

3. reviewed the code of MSCKF and learn how to realize the function of every part when I try to write the code myself.

   learned part of the code of SchurVINS and compared with MSCKF.

# Plan 
1. relearn the parts of the book State Estimation for Robotics which are thought to be not understood and learn the other parts when I have time.

2. consolidate and organize previous knowledge points

# Problem
1. About running algorithm, in my vision, I read the papers and run the algorithm and can get the similar results the papers given. However, the MSCKF cannot track well even with some of the Euroc dataset and InGVIO's binocular accuracy is worse than that of monocular and the accuracy is different from that given in the paper. I have no idea and I haven't know how to fix it.
1. Whether the need to be stationary when initializing gravity and angular velocity deviations in the MSCKF code means that the code may not run the result.
