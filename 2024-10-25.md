# Summary
1. prepared the [PPT](https://github.com/sleeper-L/weekly-paper/blob/else/2024-10-26%20%E5%88%98%E5%A4%A9%E5%A5%95.pptx) for the meeting.
2. learned part of the code of InGVIO and sorted out the framework partly.
3. watched the fifth lesson of _the fourteen lectures on visual SLAM_. and sorted out the content.
   This section describes the principles of camera imaging.
4. selectively learned videos and books about ROS written by Guyueju.
   The book may help me solve some questions and deepen my understanding of the framework. The previous use was problem-oriented, when it comes to a question that can't be answered directly , it's a little helpless.
# Plan 
1. solve the problems left last week.
2. listen to the following courses about SLAM-14 .
3. read the book about ROS selectively.
4. read a paper about OpenVins and spend time sorting out the frame.
5. review MSCKF and read the stereo version of MSCKF.
# Problem
1. I don't know how to make sure my experimental data authentic and effective.
