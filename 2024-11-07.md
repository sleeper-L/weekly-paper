# Summary
1. solved the problems left last week, mainly about observability,inconsistency and FEJ.

​	Observability means that  the entire state of the system can be inferred from the output of the system from the observer.

​	Inconsistency is a situation caused by linearization when applying EKF and FEJ is one of the solutions to the problem.

​	Here are some papers that help understand the conceptions above.

​	read *Improving the Accuracy of EKF-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry* briefly to learn the inconsistency and it proposed three key change including FEJ to solve the problem of inconsistency.

​	read *A First-Estimates Jacobian EKF for Improving SLAM Consistency* which explained inconsistency in two dimensions.

2. reviewed MSCKF and related paper and made the understanding of the algorithm a little bit clear.

​	I found that the previous learning of the observation model was too shallow.

3. Observability was deduced with the help of blogs and the paper written by Mingyang Li  named *Consistency of EKF-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry*.



# Plan 
1.  finish reading and commenting on the code about InGVIO
2.  consolidate and organize previous knowledge points
# Problem
1. When I tried to set up the running environment of GVINS, the Linux system crashed and I need some time to rebuild the previous environment.
1. About Jacobian, my cognition stays that it is for linearization and the way to make it is not clear.
