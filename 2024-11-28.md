# Summary
1. learned some chapters of the book *State Estimation for Robotics* and watched the lectures about the book given by Gao Xiang.

​	For the third chapter, I still need to spend more time to understand the content.

​	For the sixth chapter, I think that the book about inertial navigation written by Gongmin Yan may help a lot and I can take some time to review this part.

2. learned the four subspaces including the left null space and the right null space in matrix theory and had a brief understanding of them.

​	For example, the right null space is orthogonal complement of column space. The right null space is the set of the column vector x1、x2...xn that satisfied the equation Ax=0.

3. learned part of the use of docker although the experience involved in project is terrible. Maybe the use of docker can help me sometime in the future.
4. watched the 21 lessons of Guyue which briefly introduced the ROS and made me a little clear about the usage of various folders and files.



# Plan 
1.  keep learning the third chapter of the book State Estimation for Robotics and take notes.
2.  consolidate and organize previous knowledge points
3.  keep learning the use of ROS and read the book selectively and running algorithm slowly, no hurry
# Problem
1. I didn't know why when I catkin_build the algorithm, the progress is stuck at 10% when I had hung a ladder.
1. When I ran the algorithm, the progress died in initializing the first frame.
1. I have spent much time staying in the workspace, but every time when I review today's progress I found nothing to say. There are problems in theoretical knowledge and engineering application, keep trying and learning,  and stop feeling terrible about the progress, slow down and focus.
